# Cline AI Dashboard

A comprehensive dashboard for the Cline AI extension in the Cursor AI Editor VSCode IDE, built with React and the Magic MCP framework.

## Overview

This dashboard provides a visual interface for monitoring and controlling the Cline AI extension, focusing on key metrics, usage statistics, token utilization, cost tracking, model selection, and settings configuration. It follows strict token optimization protocols and coding standards to ensure minimal token usage and cost efficiency.

## Features

- **Key Metrics Panel**: Displays high-level statistics including total requests, tokens used, average response time, and cache hit rate.
- **Usage Statistics**: Breaks down AI usage patterns, showing historical data and usage by application type.
- **Token Utilization**: Visualizes token budget utilization and cache efficiency metrics in accordance with token optimization protocols.
- **Cost Tracker**: Monitors cost metrics and highlights savings from token optimization strategies.
- **Model Selector**: Allows manual and automatic selection of AI models based on task complexity and token budget.
- **Settings Panel**: Provides configuration options for token budgets, optimization settings, and general preferences.

## Implementation Details

### Token Optimization

The dashboard implements token optimization protocols in several ways:

1. **Model Selection Logic**: Automatically selects the most efficient model based on token budget and task complexity
2. **Budget Visualization**: Provides clear visibility into token usage against budgets
3. **Cache Efficiency Tracking**: Monitors cache hit rates across priority levels (L1, L2, L3)

### Responsive Design

The dashboard uses a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes:
- Desktop: Multi-column grid with specialized panel sizing
- Mobile: Single column layout with adapted content

### Theme Support

Supports both light and dark themes through CSS variables and theme toggling.

## Usage

### API Integration

The dashboard fetches data from the Cline AI extension API:

```javascript
const fetchDashboardData = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await fetch('/api/cline/dashboard-data');
    const jsonData = await data.json();
    setMetrics(jsonData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching dashboard data:', error);
  }
};
```

### Data Refresh

Data is automatically refreshed every 30 seconds to maintain current metrics:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchDashboardData();
  const intervalId = setInterval(fetchDashboardData, 30000);

  return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
}, []);
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite verifies all dashboard functionality:

- Component rendering tests
- Data processing tests
- Interaction tests
- Theme switching tests
- Responsive behavior tests

Run tests with:

```
npm test
```

## Extension

To extend the dashboard with new panels:

1. Create a new component in the `components/` directory
2. Add styling for your component in `styles.css`
3. Import and include your component in `index.js`
4. Add tests for your component in the test suite

## Protocols Compliance

This dashboard implementation strictly adheres to:
- Token Optimization Protocols
- Coding Standards
- Implementation Workflows
- Directory Management Protocols
- Error Fixing Protocols

All code is minimal, precise, and optimized for token usage and cost efficiency.
