Cline AI Dashboard â€“ Essential Features & Visualizations
1. Usage & Cost Metrics
* Total Token Usage
    * Tokens used today, this week, and this month
    * Breakdown by model (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash)
* API Cost
    * AU$ spent (today, week, month)
    * Cost per request (average, min, max)
* Token Budget Compliance
    * % of requests within configured token budgets
    * Number of over-budget requests (with links to details)
2. Model & Task Analytics
* Model Selection Distribution
    * Pie/bar chart: how often each model is used (per selection rule)
* Task Type Breakdown
    * Requests by task type (code review, debug, code generation, analysis)
    * Average tokens/cost per task type
3. Performance & Caching
* Cache Efficiency
    * L1/L2/L3 cache hit rates (actual vs. expected)
    * Number of cache hits vs. misses
    * Top cached operations (error resolutions, code patterns)
* Request Latency
    * Average and max latency per model and cache tier
4. Error Handling & Quality
* Error Resolution Stats
    * Number of errors detected and resolved (per error type)
    * Average time/cost to resolution
    * Top recurring error patterns (with links to cached solutions)
* Root Cause Analysis Coverage
    * % of errors with root cause analysis performed
    * Number of errors resolved within 2 attempts (per protocol)
5. Code Quality & Protocol Compliance
* Protocol Adherence
    * Compliance with coding, implementation, and token optimization protocols (pass/fail, %)
    * Violations detected (with links to details)
* Output Minimization
    * % of responses using code-only mode
    * Average response length (tokens)
* Context Window Optimization
    * Average context window size per request
    * % of requests using selective context loading
6. Directory & Duplication Management
* Duplication Alerts
    * Number of duplicate files/code blocks/scripts detected/prevented
    * Actions taken (refactor, consolidate, etc.)
7. System Health & Configuration
* Cache and Plugin Status
    * Redis/Disk/API cache connectivity and health
    * Plugin status (enabled/disabled, version)
* Active Model/Plugin Config
    * Current model, mode, and plugin in use
    * Current token budgets and selection rules
Functionalities
* Interactive Filters: Filter metrics by time period, model, task type, or user.
* Drill-Down Links: Click any metric to view request-level details (code region, file, line number).
* Export/Download: Export analytics as CSV or JSON for auditing.
* Alerts/Recommendations: Automated suggestions to optimize token usage, resolve protocol violations, or improve cache hit rates.
